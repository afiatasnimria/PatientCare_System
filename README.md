# PatientCare_System
A high-fidelity UI/UX design and interactive prototype for a comprehensive healthcare platform, designed as a SAD (Software Analysis and Design) lab project. The system connects patients with essential medical services, real-time emergency support, and vital health alerts.

Figma UI/UX Prototyping: Designed the complete, high-fidelity interfaces for both the native mobile (iOS/Android) and responsive web applications.

Comprehensive Booking Flows: Includes detailed, multi-step user journeys for Doctor & Nurse Booking, allowing users to search/filter by specialty, view profiles, select time slots, and manage appointments.

Integrated Emergency Suite:

SOS Emergency: A high-visibility, one-touch UI that instantly alerts contacts and services with the user's live location.

Ambulance Service: A complete flow from on-demand request and location confirmation to real-time dispatch tracking on a map.

Innovative UI Components:

Interactive Skeleton: A unique graphical interface for both male and female models where users can click on a body part to find the relevant doctor or medical department.

Dynamic Elements: Utilizes carousel windows (for featured doctors or alerts) and flip cards (for displaying provider information).

Geospatial Design: Features a map-based "Find Hospital" utility with a scrollable map to locate nearby hospitals, clinics, and pharmacies, complete with detailed info cards.

Public Health Module: Designed the UI for pushing critical, geo-targeted Epidemic Alerts, including push notification templates and an in-app alert center.

Complete Design System: A full library of reusable components (buttons, forms, cards, navigation) was built in Figma to ensure visual consistency and scalability.

Interactive Prototypes: All screens are connected to simulate the full user journey. The primary user paths are demonstrated in Flow 22 (Mobile) and Flow 3 (Web) within the Figma file.
